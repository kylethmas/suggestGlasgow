There is a user for the tester to use if needed in the population script which doesn't have any likes, dislikes or saves 
associated with it alternatively you can create a new user:

- Password: testtest

We do not have a paid licence for the maps API so any page which uses the API will have a pop up box

However, this doesn't affect the functionality of our website as you can simply click "Ok"
